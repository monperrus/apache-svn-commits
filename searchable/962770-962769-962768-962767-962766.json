   "DERBY-4731 XA two phase commit with active GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE causes An internal error identified by RawStore module", 
   "Backported fix #962738 from 10.6 codeline to 10.5 codeline.", 
   "For temp tables declared as following derby needs to do special work at the", 
   "time of commit to arrange for the temporary table to have no rows once the", 
   "commit completes.:", 
   "DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE SESSION.T1 ( XWSID INT) ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS NOT LOGGED ON ROLLBACK DELETE ROWS", 
   "Derby implements these temporary tables as unlogged real internal tables with", 
   "backing containers on disk. The ddl is all in memory so that they are only", 
   "seen by the current session. On commit the underlying container is dropped and", 
   "a new empty container is created.", 
   "This all works fine except in the XA case. In this case the transaction", 
   "has done real updates (temp table updates are unlogged and thus not seen", 
   "as update operations from the XA point of view), then the transaction executes", 
   "an XA prepare followed by an XA commit. No update transactions are allowed", 
   "between the prepare and the commit. The problem is that the pre-commit work", 
   "done for the temp tables was executing updates on the internal containers", 
   "(dropping and createing new ones), and raw store identified this as an XA", 
   "protocol violation. Since the work is only on internal non XA transaction", 
   "related updates it is ok to do these between the prepare and commit.", 
   "The fix arranges for this work to be done in a nested updatable user transaction", 
   "when in an XA transaction. It is ok to commit this work independently from", 
   "the parent user transaction because", 
   "for XA because it does the right thing in both possible cases:", 
   "1) If the XA transaction commits successfully then the same work has been", 
   "done. Because of where it is done in the code, the committing user can", 
   "never get access to the global temp tables between the time the nested", 
   "xact commits and the XA transaction commits.", 
   "2) If the XA transaction fails to commit somehow, then I think one of two", 
   "things will happen:", 
   "a) the session will go away, and then it does not matter what happens", 
   "to the session life objects.", 
   "b) the transaction will rollback, and on commit work which deleted the", 
   "rows is the same work that needs to get done on rollback.", 
   "The only locks the nested transaction gets is created new containers, so there", 
   "should be no problem with lock contention of the work with either the parent", 
   "transaction, or any other transactions."
